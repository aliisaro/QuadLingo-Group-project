<h2>ICT engineering project: QuadLingo </h2>

****
<h3>Project Description</h3>

****
**Quadlingo** is a fullstack app for learning languages. It is programmed using Java, JavaFX and CSS.
While it is still under development, the app will have the following features: user registration, user login, profile creation, flashcards, quizzes, achievements, and a user progress tracker.

We are a team of four people: Maisa, Cindy, Aliisa and Yasmin. We are all ICT engineering students at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. This project is part of our studies.
