<h2>ICT engineering project: QuadLingo </h2>

****
<h3>Project Description</h3>

****
**Quadlingo** is a fullstack app for learning languages. It is programmed using Java, JavaFX and CSS.

The app is designed to help English, French, Chinese and Arabian speakers learn the basics of Finnish. The app has a variety of features such as: user profile and progress, flashcards, quizzes and achievements.
With the help of these features, the user can learn Finnish in a fun and interactive way.

<h3>Technology utilized</h3>

****

For coding the projects Frontend and Backend we used Java, JavaFX and CSS. The whole project was made using IntelliJ IDEA.
Since the project is a group project, we used GitHub for version control and Trello for project management. The prototype was made on Figma.
We also used Google Docs for project Sprint documentation and Google Sheets for tracking work hours.

Artificial intelligence was used for writing the questions and answers for the quizzes. For writing the code of some of the functionalities in this project, we used ChatGpt and Copilot.
