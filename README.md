<h2>ICT engineering project: QuadLingo </h2>

<h3>Project Description</h3>

<h3>Technology utilized</h3>

****

For coding the projects Frontend and Backend we used Java, JavaFX and CSS. The whole project was made using IntelliJ IDEA.
Since the project is a group project, we used GitHub for version control and Trello for project management. The prototype was made on Figma.
We also used Google Docs for project Sprint documentation and Google Sheets for tracking work hours.

Artificial intelligence was used for writing the questions and answers for the quizzes. For writing the code of some of the functionalities in this project, we used ChatGpt and Copilot.
